# Welcome to HelpVu - A Beacon of Hope in Challenging Times

## DevJam 4.0(MNNIT) Project

In the face of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, HelpVu emerges as a beacon of hope and assistance for those in need. Recognizing the critical shortage of beds and oxygen supply for COVID-19 treatment, we have made it our mission to address this pressing issue.

### Our Purpose

HelpVu, a Web-based service portal developed for DevJam 4.0(MNNIT), aims to decentralize the bed registration process in hospitals. Our primary objective is to ensure that every individual has access to timely treatment, reducing the risk of losing loved ones to the virus.

### Key Features

1. **Real-time Bed Status:** Users can effortlessly check the bed availability, the current number of COVID-19 patients, and the count of recovered patients in nearby hospitals. This information empowers individuals to make informed decisions regarding their treatment.

2. **Booking Convenience:** HelpVu provides a user-friendly platform where users can book beds for themselves and their family members after submitting their COVID-19 test reports. This streamlines the process and ensures efficient utilization of available resources.

3. **Live Map Feature:** A dedicated live map feature integrates data from a live API, visually representing the distribution of COVID-19 cases worldwide. Different colors indicate varying case numbers, offering a comprehensive overview of the global situation.

4. **News Updates:** Stay informed with the latest developments through our live news API. We provide users with up-to-date information on global happenings related to the pandemic, helping them stay vigilant and aware.

5. **Hospital Portal:** Hospitals play a crucial role in our ecosystem. The HelpVu Hospital Portal allows medical facilities to log in and update real-time information about the number of patients, available beds, and oxygen reserves. This data ensures effective coordination between the government and healthcare providers.
